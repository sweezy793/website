<h1>Unmanned Falcon 9: The first success record for SpaceX</h1>
<center><img src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NGiRe2da24KUCDjBSo09TFgvITA=/0x0:2887x1925/920x613/filters:focal(1214x733:1674x1193):format(webp)/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52810245/31579784413_83aeac560a_o.0.jpg" alt="SapceX" style="width:800px;height:600px;"></center>
<h2><u>Highlights</u></h2>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">1. Falcon 9 is an EELV-class medium-lift vehicle.<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">2. It successfully delivered 10 satellites to low-Earth orbit on January 14, 2017 <center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">3. Elon Musk plans to get humans to Mars in 6 years.<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">After a string of complicated launchpad explosions and technical failures, SpaceX got its first successful launch this Saturday. The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Vadenberg  Air Force Base in California at 5:54pm GMT, carrying a payload of 10 satellites for Iridium, a mobile and data communications company. The reusable launch vehicle, Falcon 9, is an EELV-class medium-lift vehicle capable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms to orbit, and is intended to compete with the Delta IV and the Atlas V rockets, as well as other launch providers around the world.</p></center>
<h3>Sole Objectives and Media Reception</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">SpaceX’s projects employ efforts to bring down the cost of space flight by re-using multimillion dollar components instead of jettisoning them into the ocean. As a result of Elon Musk's goal of crafting more cost-effective launch vehicles, SpaceX conceived a method to reuse the first stage of their primary rocket, the Falcon 9, by attempting propulsive vertical landings on solid surfaces. Once the company determined that soft landings were feasible by touching down over the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, they began landing attempts on a solid platform. SpaceX leased and modified several barges to sit out at sea as a target for the returning first stage, converting them to autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS).</p></center>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">The recent Saturday launch had the chief purpose to safely deliver the satellite payload into the orbit and help upgrade Iridium’s global communications network. This $3 billion project aims to deploy 81 satellites to space in the coming months. The drone-ship attracted diverse media personnel and garnered plenty of excitement and cheers. Live video images at SpaceX mission control at Hawthorne showed the separation of rocket sections and steady upright landing of the first stage on the destination platform in the Pacific Ocean.It had nine Merlin engines in its first stage. It was the first demonstration of the Falcon-Heavy range of launch vehicles.</p></center>
<h3>Past Set-Backs and Financial Shortcomings</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">A series of accidents like the blasting of $200 million satellite planned to beam high speed internet to Africa by Facebook led to launch delays and financial concerns. This led to an annual loss of a quarter billion dollars and six percent drop in revenue.Spacecom claims its contract, since the launch failed, allows it to choose to receive $50 million or a future flight at no cost. Musk described the event as the "most difficult and complex failure" ever in SpaceX's 14-year history; SpaceX reviewed nearly 3,000 channels of telemetry and video data covering a period of 35–55 milliseconds for the postmortem. In late September, SpaceX stated that interim results suggested that a major breach of the cryogenic helium system of the second stage rocket had occurred. Other failures like the obliteration of Dragon cargo ship, carrying goods for astronauts at the International Space Station, the causality being a faulty strut leading to loosening of helium tank led to negative cash flow of roughly $15 million.</p></center>

<h3>SpaceX’s Collaborations</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Founded in 2002, SpaceX has contract and crew collaborations with NASA to supply the Dragon space capsule to International Space Station, revolutionize the launch industry by making rocket components reusable and Mars colonization. The company has logged 18 successful launches till date.SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded, Falcon 1 to reach orbit, in 2008;  the first privately funded company to successfully launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft (Dragon), in 2010 and sending it to a spacecraft (Dragon) to the ISS, in 2012.The launch of SES-8, in 2013, was the first SpaceX delivery into geosynchronous orbit, while the launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), in 2015, was the company's first delivery beyond Earth orbit.</p></center>
