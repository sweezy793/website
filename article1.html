<h1>Samsung Galaxy S8: Everything you need to know</h1>
<center><img src="http://cdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/17/01/galaxy-s8-dimensions/-728/gsmarena_007.jpg" alt="S8" style="width:600px;height:400px;"></center>
<h2><u>Highlights</u></h2>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">1. Samsung Galaxy S8 is tipped to come with a dual-edged curve display.<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">2. It is expected to sport the Natural ID FS9100 optical fingerprint scanner.<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">3. It is also expected to ditch the Home Button, audio jack.<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">With the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, Samsung has lost a lot more than just billions of dollars last year. The South Korean giant has spent considerable time and effort in making amends to Galaxy Note 7 buyers, fixing its reputation, as well as identifying the cause behind the smartphone's explosions. And the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 is its first big bet to move past the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco.

Therefore, it is no surprise that all eyes have been on Samsung Galaxy S8 leaks, much more than for other flagship smartphone, as 2017 is expected be the year of redemption for the company. Curious about the Samsung Galaxy S8? Here's everything we know about the Samsung's 2017 flagship.</p></center>
<h3>When will the new Galaxy S8 come out?</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">While Samsung was expected to be on schedule and launch the Galaxy S8 in February, recent reports indicate a delay due to the Note 7 fiasco and major design changes. The smartphone was expected to be unveiled at MWC this year, but Naver reports a further delay. The most recent pegged launch date is at April 18, and Samsung will launch the Galaxy S8 at a dedicated Unpacked event. The Samsung Galaxy S8 release date is not known, nor its release date in India.</p></center>
<h3>Galaxy S8 Display</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Samsung Galaxy S8 is pegged to have a dual-edged curved display with almost negligible bezel. There was an early report that pegged the screen-to-body ratio at 90 percent. The recent photo leak shows that the display takes up all the space, and only the top and bottom bezel are seen; a promotional video by Samsung that is said to feature the upcoming Galaxy S8 also shows that the smartphone has thin bezels on the sides, and that the display takes up most of the front panel. The top bezel of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 houses the speaker, front camera, and the sensors, while the bottom bezel only houses the logo. As for specifications, one report indicates that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will feature a 5.5-inch 4K (2160x3840 pixels) Super AMOLED display and will boast of an impressive pixel density of 806ppi.</p></center>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S8 will not have Home button</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Samsung is expected to ditch the Home Button, and have an all-display front. The iconic capsule shaped button at the bottom will be ditched, along with the capacitive buttons as well. A recent photo leak testified to this rumour further, but the image strangely didn't show any on screen buttons either.</p></center>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S8 fingerprint scanner</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Traditionally, all Samsung smartphones have integrated the fingerprint sensor underneath the Home Button, but because the Home Button is being let go, the fingerprint sensor may reside at the back of the phone. Another report notes that the device may sport an optical fingerprint scanner that will enable reading thumb print through the display as well.</p></center>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S8 virtual assistant</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Samsung is widely leveraging its Viv Labs acquisition to introduce "an enhanced artificial-intelligence service" in the Galaxy S8. The developers at Viv previously founded Siri which is now Apple's digital voice-assistant on mobile devices. Samsung is calling its version Bixby, and will use the new virtual assistant in mostly all the native apps that will come pre-installed in the Galaxy S8. A separate rumour indicates that the male voice of the assistant will be called Bixby, while the female voice will be called Kestra.</p></center>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S8 processor</h3>
</h3>The Galaxy S8 flagship smartphone will likely be powered by the recently announced Snapdragon 835 SoC from Qualcomm while an Exynos 8895-based variant is also being rumoured. It will be paired with a 6GB of RAM or an 8GB of RAM.</p></center>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S8 pressure sensitive display</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Following Apple's lead, Samsung may integrate a pressure-sensitive display technology in its next flagship. Notably, Samsung's technology is expected to work similarly to Apple's 3D Touch tech introduced with the iPhone 6s. The technology will be able to distinguish between a light tap and deep press, enabling access to more functions just by pressing harder.</p></center>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S8 camera</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Samsung’s flagship phones have impressed in the camera department in recent years. The Galaxy S7, for instance, debuted ‘Dual Pixel’ technology. Every pixel on the Galaxy S7’s image sensor has two photodiodes instead of one. One of the biggest advantages of this increased pixel count is faster focus. When you’re taking a photo with an iPhone, between 5% and 10% of the pixels are used for focusing. But with the Galaxy S7, every single pixel is able to take part. More of the same with the Galaxy S8, perhaps?</p></center>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">But it gets better. The Galaxy S7 also features a large f/1.7 lens aperture and a 1/2.6-inch sensor. We already know that Samsung is hard at work developing a 1/1.7-inch sensor fit for use in smartphones, and there are rumours that there’s also a lens with a faster f/1.4 aperture in the works too. Both could feature in the Galaxy S8.</p></center>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Unfortunately, recent reports seem to suggest that neither innovation will be ready for the Galaxy S8 launch, for that matter. Instead, it seems more likely that the Galaxy S8 will tout a very similar camera module to the Galaxy S7, at least until we hear otherwise.

One key upgrade could come in the form of a dual-lens camera module. Huawei used the technology in its recently launched Huawei P9, and Apple followed suit with the iPhone 7 Plus. A smattering of such rumours regarding the Galaxy S8 have been posted to Chinese social media site Weibo – most recently by tipster I Ice Universe – but it’s too early to believe such reports.

Perhaps the best evidence of a camera upgrade so far is a recent Samsung patent filing in South Korea. The patent describes a newly improved zoom function for smartphones. This had led to speculation that Samsung plans to mimic the iPhone 7 Plus, and add a dual-camera module with a telephoto zoom lens.

In any case, we’d be very surprised if Samsung didn’t follow Apple with a dual-lens camera.</p></center>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S8 audio jack</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Just like the iPhone 7 rumours, the audio jack leaks of the Galaxy S8 have been aplenty. Reports indicate that Samsung is getting rid of the old 3.5mm audio standard, and will bundle a 3.5mm-headphone-to-USB Type-C adapter, just like Apple. A separate report also hints that Samsung will launch wireless headphones alongside as well.</p></center>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S8's Continuum-like feature</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Lastly, the Galaxy S8 is also tipped to come with something similar to the popular Continuum feature seen on Windows 10 Mobile devices. This means that you could use your smartphone on your PC by connecting the device to the monitor, and the keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth (presumably). According to the leak, the feature is being called the Samsung Desktop Experience.</p></center>
