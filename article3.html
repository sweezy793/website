<h1>Faraday Future FF 91: The Next Generation Mobility </h1>
<center><img src="https://cms-cdn.ff.com/ffcmsproduction/cms/uploads/MediaPost/FF_91_Exterior_1_5a0097f5-860d-404e-ba2f-fd5cc318765d.jpg" alt="FF91" style="width:900px;height:600px;"></center>
<h2><u>Highlights</u></h2>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">1. Faraday Future FF91 sports a 1050 HP engine and can go 0-60 mph in just 2.39 seconds.<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">2. It packs a 130 kWh high density energy battery.<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">3. The FF91 will cost "less than 2 million Chinese yuan".<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">The American start-up technology company, Faraday Future, debuted its first all-electric production intent vehicle, the connected car based on advanced telematics, FF 91, at the January 2017 Consumer Electronics Show(CES). Only 300 “Alliance Edition” launch units will be available, with first deliveries expected in 2018. The paint job on the prototypes unveiled at CES and the one showed in the press package has quite impressive looks. Built upon the company’s Variable Platform Architecture (VPA), FF 91 represents a bold new breed of electric mobility that blendsflexible powertrain functions, seamless performance, the comfort of an ultra-luxury passenger vehicle, and a unique collection of intelligent internet features.</p></center>
<h3>Distinguishing Features</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">It has a lot to offer, including features like the Driverless Valet Parking, Keyless Entry, Facial Recognition Technology, global user profile that travels with the user through the FF Ecosystem, “Best in class” high-speed internet on the road and a first class experience with NASA-inspired zero gravity seats that provide industry leading rear seat reclining position.Creating a FFID account establishes a global profile that travels with users through the FF Ecosystem and remembers personal preferences, such as seating positions, favorite music and movies, ideal temperatures, and driving style settings to ensure users have a consistent experience powered by multiple in-car modems. Interior cameras recognize users and automatically adjust interior settings to their preferences. FF 91 can not only recognize faces, but also facial expressions and moods it uses to auto-prompt an experience to match, using music, temperature, scent, content, messages and more. Users’ facial recognition data is saved natively and securely in the vehicle.</p></center>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">The standard rearview mirror has been replaced by a high definition display that merges the live feed from the side mirrors and rearview camera into a single, seamless image. Combined with the views from the exterior mirror cameras, the overall system improves safety by creating a wider exterior field of vision from inside FF 91.The Driverless Valet parking feature enables FF 91 to park itself after the driver has exited the vehicle. Powered by the FFCTRL app, drivers can also summon the vehicle from its parking spot or schedule a pick up at a desired time and location.
</p></center>
<h3>Design Specifications</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">This premium, intuitive and seamlessly connected vehicle is packed with 1050 HP power, acceleration of 0-60 mph in 2.39 seconds and a wheelbase of 126" / 3200mm. Other modulated stats include a range of 378 miles (EPA est.) and over 700 km (NEDC est.), charging speed of more than 500 miles per hour with an ADAS Sensor Suite having components like 13 long and short range radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, 10 high definition cameras, one 3D retractable lidar.</p></center> 
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">FF 91’s design philosophy is driven by aerodynamics. The sleek, rounded front fascia and edgy, angular rear create a striking form that improves aerodynamic efficiency to increase range. The signature UFO line that runs around the mid-section of the vehicle provides FF 91 with a unique but simple, stabilizing design element. Similarly, the wide stance and long wheelbase deliver a spacious and luxurious interior environment. FF 91’s gateway doors blend form and function by providing a stylish entry system with easier accessibility. Each door can open automatically and independently, allowing for quick and convenient passenger pick up. Sensors prevent the doors from opening too wide and making unwanted contact with the surrounding objects.FF 91’s exterior lighting is focused on communication. The vehicle reimagines lighting systems by creating a deeper connection between car and driver. When users approach FF 91, the vehicle’s rocker panel illuminate with an owner confirmation sequence that brightens based on proximity – FF 91 recognizes and welcomes you. The system uses intuitive patterns to communicate messages to its users like welcome sequences and charging states, as well as autonomous driving mode prompts. By design, the lighting system will improve safety by informing pedestrians and other drivers when FF 91 is driving autonomously.

<h3>Estimated price range and reservation</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Jia Yueting, CEO of LeEco and Faraday Future’s main backer, gave us our best idea of the estimated price by saying that will cost “less than $300,000”. But the price range of the all-electric vehicle has so far been elusive and the company has never confirmed it. It wouldn’t be cheap considering it is equipped with a 130 kWh battery pack and it features tons of gadgets, like a retractable lidar sensor, touch-sensitive screens all around the car, and much more.</p></center>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">FF will begin accepting reservations for FF 91 through the company’s newly redesigned website, FF.com. Reservations are $5,000 and are fully refundable.The first 300 orders will have the opportunity to upgrade to an exclusive launch series, the Alliance Edition, in March 2017. A portion of the sales proceeds for each Alliance Edition sold will be donated towards an environmental fund which closely aligns with FF’s sustainability efforts. Additionally, the first unit of the FF 91 Alliance Edition will be auctioned at a gala in March. The production of FF 91 is planned to start in 2018.
