<h1>Apple iPhone 8 Leaks and Rumours So Far - Specifications, Release Date, and More</h1>
<center><img src="http://cdn.bgr.com/2017/01/iphone-8-concept.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&w=900" alt="iPhone 8" style="width:550px;height:500px;"></center>
<h2><u>Highlights</u></h2>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">1. Apple iPhone 8 may not have the Home button<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">2. It is expected to sport a Holographic Display.<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: Segoe UI;color:red;font-size: 20px;">3. Rumoured iPhone 8 features include OLED screen, wireless charging and 5G Technology<center><p>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Apple’s 2017 flagship iPhone is supposedly called the iPhone 8, though the company is also rumored to be releasing an iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 7s this year. Of those three, the iPhone 8 is going to be the most exciting new iPhone. Numerous reports claim that we’re looking at an all-screen, glass sandwich design for the iPhone 8, complete with curved edges, no home button, and wireless charging support.The iPhone launch is usually the biggest technology event of the year, but the launch of the iPhone 8 will be even more important, as 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone. With such a momentous occasion at hand, all eyes are on Apple, and all the new features it is expected to bring to the iPhone product line.</p></center>
<h3>iPhone 8 release date</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">A launch event in the first or second week of September 2017, with the phones hitting stores one to two weeks later, is our best guess.</p></center>
<h3>iPhone 8 Display</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Apple hasn't done much with its iPhone screens since upping the sizes with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, but the iPhone 8 could see the display undergo its biggest change yet, with respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claiming that the iPhone 8 will have a curved AMOLED display.As well as sporting a new technology and curves, the iPhone 8 display could also be larger, with Ming-Chi Kuo claiming it could be up to 5.8 inches, which would make the phone even larger than the 5.7-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 7.</p></center>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">But despite the larger screen size the phone itself might not be much bigger, as way back in 2015 we heard talk from Taiwan that Apple was working on a way to get rid of the home button and build Touch ID into the screen itself, potentially eliminating the bezels in the process.

More recently Apple blogger John Gruber made similar claims, saying that "the entire face will be the display. And the Touch ID sensor will be somehow embedded in the display. The front-facing camera will somehow be embedded in the display. The speaker, everything. All the sensors will somehow be behind the display."

Apple tweaked the home button this year, making it no longer physically click when pressed, so this could be the next step. On the other hand, you could argue that since Apple only just tweaked the button it's unlikely to ditch it so soon.</p></center>
<h3>iPhone 8 will not have Home button</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">This is the most frequenty leaked of all rumoured iPhone 8 features: that the iPhone 8 will not have the Home button. Instead, the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the selfie camera of the iPhone 8 will be integrated in the touchscreen itself. iPhone 8 may even have some new 3D Touch functionalities that enable it to replace some of the functions of the Home button.</p></center>
<h3>iPhone 8 will probably have wireless charging</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Another common iPhone 8 leaked is wireless charging. While wireless charging has been used by many smartphones, Apple’s take on the feature will be different. Apparently, iPhone 8 will feature long-range wireless charging that will not require the user to place the device on a charging station or even very close to it. South Korea’s Economic Daily News says Apple will use a wireless charging back cover for iPhone 8, so the feature may not be built-in.</p></center>
<h3>iPhone 8 may have an iris scanner</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">The ill-fated Samsung Galaxy Note 7 had an iris scanner, and the feature may make its way to the next Apple flagship smartphone as well, according to iPhone 8 leaks. Ming-Chi Kuo says Apple is working on introducing advance biometric features in the smartphone, so an iris scanner on the iPhone 8 may indeed become a reality. However, some reports say that the iris scanner feature will be ready for 2018, and not next year.</p></center>
<h3>iPhone 8 OS and power</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">It's very likely that the iPhone 8 will run iOS 11, given that iOS 10 has just landed, though what new features that will contain remains to be seen.

As for power, Apple only just moved to a quad-core chip with the iPhone 7 range, so we expect quad-core again for the iPhone 8, with the chip likely called the A11 or the A11 Fusion.

3GB or 4GB of RAM in both phones is likely, as while the iPhone 7 is stuck with just 2GB of RAM, the iPhone 7 Plus has 3GB and the iPad Pro 12.9 has 4GB.</p></center>

<h3>iPhone 8 camera</h3>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">The Korea Economic Daily says that Apple is studying ways to use LG Innotek’s 3D camera module in the iPhone 8. LG Innotek’s 3D camera module will be used in the iPhone 8’s dual rear camera system, alongside the 3D technology Apple acquired with the buyout of LinX in 2015, to deliver photos with 3D effects.

Apart from this, iPhone 8 may feature Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) in the telephoto lens as well as the wide-angle lens. The iPhone 7 only has OIS in the wide-angle lens. The dual rear cameras of iPhone 8, at least in the rumoured 5-inch model, will be aligned vertically rather than horizontally, says a report.</p></center>
<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">While you might expect the dual-lens snapper found on the iPhone 7 Plus to filter down to the standard version of the iPhone 8 that's not likely, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who in a research note obtained by MacRumors claimed that the high cost and niche appeal of dual-lens cameras meant Apple would probably limit the tech to "high-end" models - likely meaning the iPhone 8 Plus.

In the same note he suggested that the telephoto lens in the dual-lens camera might get optical image stabilization (where currently only the wide-angle lens does), so that's one improvement we might see.

That aside, camera rumors are thin on the ground. It's possible that Apple will change the megapixel count from 12MP, though around that seems to be the sweet spot that many manufacturers have settled into, so don't count on it.</p></center>

<h3>iPhone 8 other features</h3>

<center><p style="font-family: sans-serif;">One rumored feature of the iPhone 8 is an iris scanner, which wouldn't be much of a surprise given that the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 has one, though Samsung's implementation is a bit slow and Apple isn't likely to include one unless it can improve the performance.

The iPhone 7S might tighten up security in other ways too, as an Apple patent details a system that could get a thief's fingerprints and photo, as well as recording audio, video and their location.

We might also see a Smart Connector on the iPhone 8. This was rumored for inclusion on the iPhone 7 Pro - a phone which never launched, but with numerous pictures of a phone sporting the Connector it seems likely that Apple really was considering it, so the feature might be ready by next year.

We've already seen a Smart Connector on the iPad Pro, where it's primarily used to attach accessories, like keyboards.</p></center>
